          <p>Hello guys <strong>Welcome to my website</strong> and you known that How I am? If you don't know me go to about section and find
           out <a href="about.html">about me</a> and Now let me tell you about programming language you should learn in 2020</p>
          <h1>Top 2 Programming lauguage you should learn in 2020
           <p>hello guys the top 2 programming languages are:
            <br>
            <ol>
             <li><h2>Javascript</h2></li>
             <br>
             <p>It’s impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript in some way. According to Stack Overflow's 2019 Developer Survey, JavaScript 
is the most popular language among developers for the seventh year in a row. Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents reported that they had used JavaScript in the past year.</p>
<p>Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is essential to front-end web development. A majority of the web’s most popular sites, from Facebook and Twitter to 
 Gmail and YouTube, rely on JavaScript to create interactive web pages and dynamically display content to users.</p>
<p>Although JavaScript is primarily a front-end language run on the browser, it can also be used on the server-side through Node.js to build 
 scalable network applications. Node.js is compatible with Linux, SunOS, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>Because JavaScript has a forgiving, flexible syntax and works across all major browsers, it is one of the friendliest programming languages for beginners.</p>
             <br>
             <li><h2>Python</h2></li>
             <br>
            <p> Python continues to be one of the best programming languages every developer should learn this year. The language is easy-to-learn and offers a clean and 
             well-structured code, making it powerful enough to build a decent web application.</p> 
<p>Python can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based desktop applications, machine learning, data science, and network servers. The programming language 
 enjoys immense community support and offers several open-source libraries, frameworks, and modules that make application development a cakewalk.</p>
<p>For instance, Python offers Django and Flask, popular libraries for web development and TensorFlow, Keras, and SciPy for data science applications. </p>
<p>Though Python has been around for a while, it makes sense to learn this language in 2020 as it can help you get a job or a freelance project quickly, thereby 
 accelerating your career growth.</p>
